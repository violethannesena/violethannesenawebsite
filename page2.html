        Violet Hannesena is a sound artist, violinist and improviser who invites listeners to connect with the inherent beauty and complexity of the world around us. She is currently pursuing her bachelor's degree at the California Institute of the Arts in violin performance and composition. 
        <br>
        <br> 
        Grounded in a deep understanding of both classical and new music, Battaglia began playing classical violin at the age of nine, later experimenting with improvisation in Bluegrass and Swing styles. Her formative years spent in orchestras and chamber ensembles coached by the Kronos Quartet paved the way for an eclectic synthesis of folk, classical, electronic and improvisational sound work. She has performed alongside musicians such as Andrew McIntosh, Mattie Barbier, and Tim Feeney, and frequently collaborates with dancers and filmmakers. Violet has presented work at Human Resources, Coaxial, New Music On The Point, The Fonda, The Roy O. Disney Theatre Hall, The Troubadour, LA Artcore, Oracle Egg, Highways Performance Space and Gallery and on Dublab Radio.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Her practice centers around overtone complexity and psychoacoustic phenomena through temperament, intonation, and extended-duration performances. She strives to unveil the invisible physicality of sound - an investigation into aerial gestures, natural generativity and ephemeral spaces in order to come into resonance with our environments and selves. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Originally from San Francisco, Battaglia is currently based in Los Angeles, CA.
